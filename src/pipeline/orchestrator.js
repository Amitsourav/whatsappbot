/**
 * The pipeline: a WhatsApp message in, a CRM lead out.
 *
 *   message in a monitored group
 *        │
 *        ├─ is it a reply to a lead we know?  ──> update that lead
 *        └─ otherwise                          ──> is it a new lead?
 *
 * Two principles run through all of it:
 *
 *   Record before acting. Every message is written to our database BEFORE the CRM
 *   is called. WhatsApp redelivers after a reconnect and a network failure leaves
 *   us unable to tell whether the CRM committed — recording first makes both
 *   recoverable instead of producing duplicate leads.
 *
 *   Never lose information. A message we cannot use is stored with a reason, not
 *   dropped. Held leads wait for a human; unrecognised text becomes a remark.
